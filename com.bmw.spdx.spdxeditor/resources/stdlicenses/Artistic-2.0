         The Artistic License 2.0<br/>
<br/>
     Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
<br/>
Preamble<br/>
<br/>
This license establishes the terms under which a given free software<br/>
Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.<br/>
The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic<br/>
control over the development of that Package while still keeping the<br/>
Package available as open source and free software.<br/>
<br/>
You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this<br/>
license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the<br/>
terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to<br/>
make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek<br/>
a different licensing arrangement. <br/>
<br/>
Definitions<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; means the individual(s) or organization(s)<br/>
    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;Contributor&quot; means any party that has contributed code or other<br/>
    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder&apos;s<br/>
    procedures.<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;You&quot; and &quot;your&quot; means any person who would like to copy,<br/>
    distribute, or modify the Package.<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;Package&quot; means the collection of files distributed by the<br/>
    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of<br/>
    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard<br/>
    Version, or a Modified Version.<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;Distribute&quot; means providing a copy of the Package or making it<br/>
    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or<br/>
    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;Distributor Fee&quot; means any fee that you charge for Distributing<br/>
    this Package or providing support for this Package to another<br/>
    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to the Package if it has not been<br/>
    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested<br/>
    by the Copyright Holder.<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;Modified Version&quot; means the Package, if it has been changed, and<br/>
    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright<br/>
    Holder. <br/>
<br/>
    &quot;Original License&quot; means this Artistic License as Distributed with<br/>
    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as<br/>
    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;Source&quot; form means the source code, documentation source, and<br/>
    configuration files for the Package.<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;Compiled&quot; form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,<br/>
    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or<br/>
    translation of the Source form.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution<br/>
<br/>
(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use<br/>
Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that<br/>
you do not Distribute the Modified Version.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version<br/>
<br/>
(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the<br/>
Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,<br/>
either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate<br/>
all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At<br/>
your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a<br/>
Compiled form of the Package.<br/>
<br/>
(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other<br/>
modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting<br/>
Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such<br/>
will be subject to the Original License.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source <br/>
<br/>
(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis<br/>
or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the<br/>
Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs<br/>
from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting<br/>
any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that<br/>
you do at least ONE of the following:<br/>
<br/>
    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder<br/>
    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the<br/>
    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard<br/>
    Version.<br/>
<br/>
    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not<br/>
    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In<br/>
    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different<br/>
    from the name of the Standard Version.<br/>
<br/>
    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to<br/>
    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others<br/>
    under<br/>
  <br/>
 	(i)  the Original License or<br/>
<br/>
 	(ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,<br/>
 	modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same<br/>
 	licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee<br/>
 	received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified<br/>
 	Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely<br/>
 	available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor<br/>
 	Fees are allowed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version <br/>
or Modified Versions without the Source<br/>
<br/>
(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without<br/>
the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to<br/>
get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be<br/>
valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any<br/>
time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you<br/>
must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.<br/>
If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty<br/>
days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then<br/>
you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.<br/>
<br/>
(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without<br/>
the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to<br/>
the Source of the Modified Version.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aggregating or Linking the Package <br/>
<br/>
(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or<br/>
Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting<br/>
aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the<br/>
Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other<br/>
components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license<br/>
apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions<br/>
as included in the aggregation.<br/>
<br/>
(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with<br/>
other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to<br/>
build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that<br/>
include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,<br/>
provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version <br/>
<br/>
(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that<br/>
merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause<br/>
the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not<br/>
considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the<br/>
terms of this license.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
General Provisions<br/>
<br/>
(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or<br/>
Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,<br/>
modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not<br/>
use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this<br/>
license.<br/>
<br/>
(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified<br/>
Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required<br/>
to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of<br/>
this license.<br/>
<br/>
(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,<br/>
service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.<br/>
<br/>
(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,<br/>
free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,<br/>
sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any<br/>
patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily<br/>
infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation<br/>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging<br/>
that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent<br/>
infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the<br/>
date that such litigation is filed.<br/>
<br/>
(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:<br/>
THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS &quot;AS<br/>
IS&apos; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED<br/>
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR<br/>
NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL<br/>
LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL<br/>
BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL<br/>
DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF<br/>
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
