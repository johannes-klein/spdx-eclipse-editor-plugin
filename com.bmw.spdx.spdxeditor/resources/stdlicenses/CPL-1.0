Common Public License Version 1.0<br/>
<br/>
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC<br/>
LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM<br/>
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br/>
<br/>
1. DEFINITIONS<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Contribution&quot; means:<br/>
<br/>
 a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and<br/>
 documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<br/>
<br/>
 b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br/>
<br/>
   i) changes to the Program, and<br/>
<br/>
   ii) additions to the Program;<br/>
<br/>
   where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are<br/>
   distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a<br/>
   Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone<br/>
   acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to<br/>
   the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in<br/>
   conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not<br/>
   derivative works of the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are<br/>
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when<br/>
combined with the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,<br/>
including all Contributors.<br/>
<br/>
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br/>
<br/>
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants<br/>
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to<br/>
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,<br/>
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such<br/>
derivative works, in source code and object code form.<br/>
<br/>
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants<br/>
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed<br/>
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the<br/>
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.<br/>
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the<br/>
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such<br/>
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the<br/>
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations<br/>
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br/>
<br/>
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses<br/>
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any<br/>
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual<br/>
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to<br/>
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of<br/>
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the<br/>
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole<br/>
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.<br/>
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to<br/>
distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire that license<br/>
before distributing the Program.<br/>
<br/>
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient<br/>
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set<br/>
forth in this Agreement.<br/>
<br/>
3. REQUIREMENTS<br/>
<br/>
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its<br/>
own license agreement, provided that:<br/>
<br/>
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br/>
<br/>
b) its license agreement:<br/>
<br/>
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and<br/>
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and<br/>
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and<br/>
fitness for a particular purpose;<br/>
<br/>
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for<br/>
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential<br/>
damages, such as lost profits;<br/>
<br/>
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered<br/>
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br/>
<br/>
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such<br/>
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or<br/>
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.<br/>
<br/>
When the Program is made available in source code form:<br/>
<br/>
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br/>
<br/>
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.<br/>
<br/>
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the<br/>
Program.<br/>
<br/>
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if<br/>
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the<br/>
originator of the Contribution.<br/>
<br/>
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br/>
<br/>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with<br/>
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is<br/>
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who<br/>
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner<br/>
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if<br/>
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such<br/>
Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify<br/>
every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages<br/>
and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal<br/>
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the<br/>
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in<br/>
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product<br/>
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses<br/>
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order<br/>
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial<br/>
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to<br/>
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any<br/>
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in<br/>
any such claim at its own expense.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product<br/>
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that<br/>
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties<br/>
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such<br/>
Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the<br/>
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other<br/>
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court<br/>
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial<br/>
Contributor must pay those damages.<br/>
<br/>
5. NO WARRANTY<br/>
<br/>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN<br/>
&quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR<br/>
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,<br/>
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each<br/>
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and<br/>
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of<br/>
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of<br/>
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,<br/>
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br/>
<br/>
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br/>
<br/>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY<br/>
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,<br/>
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST<br/>
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,<br/>
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY<br/>
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS<br/>
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
<br/>
7. GENERAL<br/>
<br/>
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable<br/>
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the<br/>
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such<br/>
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such<br/>
provision valid and enforceable.<br/>
<br/>
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to<br/>
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a<br/>
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient<br/>
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In<br/>
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity<br/>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program<br/>
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)<br/>
infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under<br/>
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/>
<br/>
All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to<br/>
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does<br/>
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of<br/>
such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate,<br/>
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as<br/>
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under this Agreement<br/>
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and<br/>
survive.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in<br/>
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be<br/>
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to<br/>
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.<br/>
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.<br/>
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve<br/>
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the<br/>
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including<br/>
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement<br/>
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement<br/>
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its<br/>
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections<br/>
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the<br/>
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether<br/>
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not<br/>
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.<br/>
<br/>
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the<br/>
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this<br/>
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year<br/>
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in<br/>
any resulting litigation.
