IBM Public License Version 1.0<br/>
<br/>
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM<br/>
PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION<br/>
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br/>
<br/>
1. DEFINITIONS<br/>
&quot;Contribution&quot; means:<br/>
<br/>
a.  in the case of International Business Machines Corporation (&quot;IBM&quot;), the Original Program, and<br/>
<br/>
b.  in the case of each Contributor,<br/>
	i.  changes to the Program, and<br/>
	ii.  additions to the Program;<br/>
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and<br/>
are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution<br/>
&apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by<br/>
such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s<br/>
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:<br/>
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with<br/>
the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not<br/>
derivative works of the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Contributor&quot; means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a<br/>
Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its<br/>
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Original Program&quot; means the original version of the software<br/>
accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source<br/>
code, object code and documentation, if any.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Program&quot; means the Original Program and Contributions.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this<br/>
Agreement, including all Contributors.<br/>
<br/>
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br/>
a.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby<br/>
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright<br/>
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,<br/>
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such<br/>
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and<br/>
object code form.<br/>
<br/>
b.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby<br/>
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent<br/>
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,<br/>
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,<br/>
if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license<br/>
shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program<br/>
if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such<br/>
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by<br/>
the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any<br/>
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per<br/>
se is licensed hereunder.<br/>
<br/>
c.  Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the<br/>
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are<br/>
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the<br/>
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.<br/>
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims<br/>
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual<br/>
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the<br/>
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes<br/>
sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights<br/>
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is<br/>
required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is<br/>
Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire that license before<br/>
distributing the Program.<br/>
<br/>
d.  Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has<br/>
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the<br/>
copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br/>
<br/>
3. REQUIREMENTS<br/>
A Contributor may choose to distribute<br/>
the Program in object code form under its own license agreement,<br/>
provided that:<br/>
<br/>
a.  it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br/>
b.  its license agreement:<br/>
	i.  effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties<br/>
	and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or<br/>
	conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or<br/>
	conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<br/>
	ii.  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability<br/>
	for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and<br/>
	consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br/>
	iii.  states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are<br/>
	offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br/>
	iv.  states that source code for the Program is available from such<br/>
	Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable<br/>
	manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.<br/>
<br/>
When the Program is made available in source code form:<br/>
a.  it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br/>
b.  a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the<br/>
Program.<br/>
<br/>
Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:<br/>
<br/>
	Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator<br/>
of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows<br/>
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.<br/>
<br/>
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br/>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain<br/>
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the<br/>
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial<br/>
use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a<br/>
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not<br/>
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a<br/>
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,<br/>
such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend<br/>
and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;)<br/>
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising<br/>
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third<br/>
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the<br/>
acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with<br/>
its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.<br/>
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses<br/>
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.<br/>
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly<br/>
notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)<br/>
allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the<br/>
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement<br/>
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any<br/>
such claim at its own expense.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial<br/>
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial<br/>
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance<br/>
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance<br/>
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s<br/>
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor<br/>
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to<br/>
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any<br/>
other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial<br/>
Contributor must pay those damages.<br/>
<br/>
5. NO WARRANTY<br/>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS<br/>
PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY<br/>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY<br/>
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY<br/>
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely<br/>
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and<br/>
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its<br/>
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to<br/>
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable<br/>
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and<br/>
unavailability or interruption of operations.<br/>
<br/>
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br/>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT<br/>
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,<br/>
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES<br/>
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON<br/>
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR<br/>
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF<br/>
THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS<br/>
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
<br/>
7. GENERAL<br/>
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under<br/>
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of<br/>
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further<br/>
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the<br/>
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br/>
<br/>
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with<br/>
respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim<br/>
or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by<br/>
that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall<br/>
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if<br/>
Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including<br/>
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program<br/>
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or<br/>
hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s<br/>
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such<br/>
litigation is filed.<br/>
<br/>
All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it<br/>
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this<br/>
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of<br/>
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s<br/>
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use<br/>
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.<br/>
However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under this Agreement and any<br/>
licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue<br/>
and survive.<br/>
<br/>
IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement<br/>
from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a<br/>
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)<br/>
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement<br/>
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the<br/>
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the<br/>
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one<br/>
other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as<br/>
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives<br/>
no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor<br/>
under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or<br/>
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under<br/>
this Agreement are reserved.<br/>
<br/>
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and<br/>
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No<br/>
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this<br/>
Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each<br/>
party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
