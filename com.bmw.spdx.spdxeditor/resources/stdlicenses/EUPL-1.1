European Union Public Licence<br/>
V. 1.1<br/>
<br/>
EUPL (c) the European Community 2007<br/>
<br/>
This European Union Public Licence (the &quot;EUPL&quot;) applies to the Work or Software<br/>
(as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the<br/>
Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use<br/>
is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).<br/>
<br/>
The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as<br/>
defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright<br/>
notice for the Original Work:<br/>
	Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1<br/>
or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL.<br/>
<br/>
1. Definitions<br/>
<br/>
In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:<br/>
<br/>
- The Licence: this Licence.<br/>
<br/>
- The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or communicated<br/>
by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable<br/>
Code as the case may be.<br/>
<br/>
- Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee,<br/>
based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define<br/>
the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to<br/>
classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law<br/>
applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.<br/>
<br/>
- The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works.<br/>
<br/>
- The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most<br/>
convenient for people to study and modify.<br/>
<br/>
- The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is<br/>
meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.<br/>
<br/>
- The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and/or communicates the<br/>
Work under the Licence.<br/>
<br/>
- Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the<br/>
Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.<br/>
<br/>
- The Licensee or &quot;You&quot;: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the<br/>
Software under the terms of the Licence.<br/>
<br/>
- Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting,<br/>
distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or<br/>
off-line, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the<br/>
disposal of any other natural or legal person.<br/>
<br/>
2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence<br/>
<br/>
The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable<br/>
licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the<br/>
Original Work:<br/>
<br/>
- use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,<br/>
- reproduce the Work,<br/>
- modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,<br/>
- communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the<br/>
Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be,<br/>
the Work,<br/>
- distribute the Work or copies thereof,<br/>
- lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,<br/>
- sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.<br/>
<br/>
Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now<br/>
known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.<br/>
<br/>
In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his<br/>
moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the<br/>
economic rights here above listed.<br/>
<br/>
The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any<br/>
patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted<br/>
on the Work under this Licence.<br/>
<br/>
3. Communication of the Source Code<br/>
<br/>
The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable<br/>
Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a<br/>
machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the<br/>
Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright<br/>
notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely<br/>
accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the<br/>
Work.<br/>
<br/>
4. Limitations on copyright<br/>
<br/>
Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any<br/>
exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original<br/>
Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations<br/>
thereto.<br/>
<br/>
5. Obligations of the Licensee<br/>
<br/>
The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations<br/>
imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:<br/>
<br/>
Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks<br/>
notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties.<br/>
The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with<br/>
every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must<br/>
cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been<br/>
modified and the date of modification.<br/>
<br/>
Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the<br/>
Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution<br/>
and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later<br/>
version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under<br/>
this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose<br/>
any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or<br/>
restrict the terms of the Licence.<br/>
<br/>
Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative<br/>
Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work<br/>
licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be<br/>
done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause,<br/>
&quot;Compatible Licence�&quot; refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this<br/>
Licence. Should the Licensee’s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict<br/>
with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence<br/>
shall prevail.<br/>
<br/>
Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the<br/>
Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or<br/>
indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long<br/>
as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.<br/>
<br/>
Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names,<br/>
trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for<br/>
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing<br/>
the content of the copyright notice.<br/>
<br/>
6. Chain of Authorship<br/>
<br/>
The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted<br/>
hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power<br/>
and authority to grant the Licence.<br/>
<br/>
Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the<br/>
Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and<br/>
authority to grant the Licence.<br/>
<br/>
Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors<br/>
grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this<br/>
Licence.<br/>
<br/>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty<br/>
<br/>
The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous<br/>
contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or &quot;bugs&quot;<br/>
inherent to this type of software development.<br/>
<br/>
For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an &quot;as is&quot; basis and<br/>
without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation<br/>
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors,<br/>
accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as<br/>
stated in Article 6 of this Licence.<br/>
<br/>
This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the<br/>
grant of any rights to the Work.<br/>
<br/>
8. Disclaimer of Liability<br/>
<br/>
Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural<br/>
persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or<br/>
moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work,<br/>
including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer<br/>
failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor<br/>
has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be<br/>
liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.<br/>
<br/>
9. Additional agreements<br/>
<br/>
While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to<br/>
conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,<br/>
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this<br/>
Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own<br/>
behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any<br/>
other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each<br/>
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such<br/>
Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.<br/>
<br/>
10. Acceptance of the Licence<br/>
<br/>
The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon &quot;I agree&quot;<br/>
placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by<br/>
affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable<br/>
law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this<br/>
Licence and all of its terms and conditions.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by<br/>
exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of<br/>
the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or<br/>
Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.<br/>
<br/>
11. Information to the public<br/>
<br/>
In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic<br/>
communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a<br/>
remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at<br/>
least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding<br/>
the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and<br/>
reproduced by the Licensee.<br/>
<br/>
12. Termination of the Licence<br/>
<br/>
The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any<br/>
breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.<br/>
Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the<br/>
Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full<br/>
compliance with the Licence.<br/>
<br/>
13. Miscellaneous<br/>
<br/>
Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement<br/>
between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.<br/>
<br/>
If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this<br/>
will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision<br/>
will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.<br/>
<br/>
The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions<br/>
of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of<br/>
the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with<br/>
a unique version number.<br/>
<br/>
All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have<br/>
identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.<br/>
<br/>
14. Jurisdiction<br/>
<br/>
Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the<br/>
European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the<br/>
jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in<br/>
article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.<br/>
<br/>
Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and<br/>
resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive<br/>
jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary<br/>
business.<br/>
<br/>
15. Applicable Law<br/>
<br/>
This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the<br/>
Licensor resides or has his registered office.<br/>
<br/>
This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:<br/>
<br/>
- a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any<br/>
Licensee;<br/>
- the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or<br/>
registered office inside a European Union country.<br/>
