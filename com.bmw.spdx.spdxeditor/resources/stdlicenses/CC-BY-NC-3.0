CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE<br/>
LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN<br/>
ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION<br/>
ON AN &quot;AS-IS&quot; BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE<br/>
INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM<br/>
ITS USE.<br/>
<br/>
License<br/>
<br/>
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE<br/>
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;CCPL&quot; OR &quot;LICENSE&quot;). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY<br/>
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS<br/>
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.<br/>
<br/>
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE<br/>
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY<br/>
BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS<br/>
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND<br/>
CONDITIONS.<br/>
<br/>
1. Definitions<br/>
<br/>
a. &quot;Adaptation&quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and<br/>
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative<br/>
work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or<br/>
artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic<br/>
adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast,<br/>
transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from<br/>
the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not<br/>
be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the<br/>
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or<br/>
phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a<br/>
moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the<br/>
purpose of this License.<br/>
<br/>
b. &quot;Collection&quot; means a collection of literary or artistic works, such<br/>
as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or<br/>
broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in<br/>
Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of<br/>
their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is<br/>
included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other<br/>
contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in<br/>
themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work<br/>
that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as<br/>
defined above) for the purposes of this License.<br/>
<br/>
c. &quot;Distribute&quot; means to make available to the public the original and<br/>
copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other<br/>
transfer of ownership.<br/>
<br/>
d. &quot;Licensor&quot; means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that<br/>
offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.<br/>
<br/>
e. &quot;Original Author&quot; means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,<br/>
the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or<br/>
if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in<br/>
addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,<br/>
musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,<br/>
play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or<br/>
expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer<br/>
being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a<br/>
performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the<br/>
organization that transmits the broadcast.<br/>
<br/>
f. &quot;Work&quot; means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the<br/>
terms of this License including without limitation any production in the<br/>
literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or<br/>
form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet<br/>
and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same<br/>
nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or<br/>
entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words;<br/>
a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a<br/>
process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,<br/>
architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work<br/>
to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to<br/>
photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch<br/>
or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,<br/>
architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a<br/>
compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable<br/>
work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent<br/>
it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.<br/>
<br/>
g. &quot;You&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this<br/>
License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with<br/>
respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the<br/>
Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous<br/>
violation.<br/>
<br/>
h. &quot;Publicly Perform&quot; means to perform public recitations of the Work<br/>
and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means<br/>
or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital<br/>
performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that<br/>
members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place<br/>
individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any<br/>
means or process and the communication to the public of the performances<br/>
of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and<br/>
rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.<br/>
<br/>
i. &quot;Reproduce&quot; means to make copies of the Work by any means including<br/>
without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of<br/>
fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a<br/>
protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic<br/>
medium.<br/>
<br/>
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,<br/>
limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from<br/>
limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the<br/>
copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.<br/>
<br/>
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,<br/>
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,<br/>
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to<br/>
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:<br/>
<br/>
a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more<br/>
Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the<br/>
Collections;<br/>
<br/>
b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such<br/>
Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable<br/>
steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes<br/>
were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be<br/>
marked &quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,&quot; or a<br/>
modification could indicate &quot;The original work has been modified.&quot;;<br/>
<br/>
c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated<br/>
in Collections; and,<br/>
<br/>
d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.<br/>
<br/>
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now<br/>
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make<br/>
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights<br/>
in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not<br/>
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not<br/>
limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d).<br/>
<br/>
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly<br/>
made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:<br/>
<br/>
a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms<br/>
of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource<br/>
Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You<br/>
Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on<br/>
the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the<br/>
recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient<br/>
under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You<br/>
must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the<br/>
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or<br/>
Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You<br/>
may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that<br/>
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the<br/>
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This<br/>
Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but<br/>
this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be<br/>
made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,<br/>
upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,<br/>
remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as<br/>
requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor<br/>
You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any<br/>
credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.<br/>
<br/>
b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3<br/>
above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward<br/>
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of<br/>
the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or<br/>
otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward<br/>
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is<br/>
no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange<br/>
of copyrighted works.<br/>
<br/>
c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or<br/>
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to<br/>
Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and<br/>
provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the<br/>
name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,<br/>
and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or<br/>
parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for<br/>
attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in Licensor&apos;s copyright notice,<br/>
terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or<br/>
parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent<br/>
reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be<br/>
associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the<br/>
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv)<br/>
consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit<br/>
identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &quot;French<br/>
translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on<br/>
original Work by Original Author&quot;). The credit required by this Section<br/>
4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,<br/>
that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit<br/>
will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation<br/>
or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at<br/>
least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.<br/>
For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this<br/>
Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,<br/>
by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or<br/>
explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or<br/>
endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,<br/>
as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,<br/>
express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or<br/>
Attribution Parties.<br/>
<br/>
d. For the avoidance of doubt:<br/>
<br/>
i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br/>
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory<br/>
licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive<br/>
right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights<br/>
granted under this License;<br/>
<br/>
ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which<br/>
the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory<br/>
licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive<br/>
right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights<br/>
granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a<br/>
purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under<br/>
Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through<br/>
any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,<br/>
<br/>
iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to<br/>
collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the<br/>
Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary<br/>
licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the<br/>
rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is<br/>
otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).<br/>
<br/>
e. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be<br/>
otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or<br/>
Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations<br/>
or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other<br/>
derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to<br/>
the Original Author&apos;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those<br/>
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted<br/>
in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be<br/>
deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory<br/>
action prejudicial to the Original Author&apos;s honor and reputation, the<br/>
Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the<br/>
fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You<br/>
to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License<br/>
(right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer<br/>
<br/>
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR<br/>
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY<br/>
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,<br/>
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,<br/>
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF<br/>
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,<br/>
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br/>
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br/>
<br/>
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE<br/>
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR<br/>
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES<br/>
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS<br/>
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
<br/>
7. Termination<br/>
<br/>
a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br/>
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.<br/>
Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections<br/>
from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses<br/>
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full<br/>
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will<br/>
survive any termination of this License.<br/>
<br/>
b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here<br/>
is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).<br/>
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the<br/>
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at<br/>
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to<br/>
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is<br/>
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this<br/>
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as<br/>
stated above.<br/>
<br/>
8. Miscellaneous<br/>
<br/>
a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a<br/>
Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work<br/>
on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under<br/>
this License.<br/>
<br/>
b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor<br/>
offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms<br/>
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.<br/>
<br/>
c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under<br/>
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of<br/>
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action<br/>
by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to<br/>
the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and<br/>
enforceable.<br/>
<br/>
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no<br/>
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing<br/>
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.<br/>
<br/>
e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties<br/>
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,<br/>
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified<br/>
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may<br/>
appear in any communication from You.  This License may not be modified<br/>
without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.<br/>
<br/>
f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this<br/>
License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention<br/>
for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on<br/>
September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright<br/>
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and<br/>
the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These<br/>
rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in<br/>
which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the<br/>
corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty<br/>
provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of<br/>
rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights<br/>
not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be<br/>
included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the<br/>
license of any rights under applicable law.<br/>
<br/>

incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this<br/>
license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative<br/>
Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it<br/>
shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.<br/>
