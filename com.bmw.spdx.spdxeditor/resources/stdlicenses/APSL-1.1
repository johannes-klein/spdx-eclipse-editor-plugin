such entity.<br/>
<br/>
2. Permitted Uses; Conditions &amp; Restrictions.  Subject to the terms<br/>
and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on<br/>
the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a<br/>
world-wide, royalty-free, non- exclusive license, to the extent of<br/>
Apple&apos;s Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original<br/>
Code, to do the following:<br/>
<br/>
2.1 You may use, copy, modify and distribute Original Code, with or<br/>
without Modifications, solely for Your internal research and<br/>
development, provided that You must in each instance:<br/>
<br/>
(a) retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright<br/>
and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear<br/>
in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code<br/>
that refer to this License;<br/>
<br/>
(b) include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of<br/>
Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer<br/>
or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this<br/>
License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder, except as permitted under<br/>
Section 6; and<br/>
<br/>
(c) completely and accurately document all Modifications that you have<br/>
made and the date of each such Modification, designate the version of<br/>
the Original Code you used, prominently include a file carrying such<br/>
information with the Modifications, and duplicate the notice in<br/>
Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all such Modifications.<br/>
<br/>
2.2 You may Deploy Covered Code, provided that You must in each<br/>
  instance:<br/>
<br/>
(a) satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the<br/>
Source Code of the Covered Code;<br/>
<br/>
(b) make all Your Deployed Modifications publicly available in Source<br/>
Code form via electronic distribution (e.g. download from a web site)<br/>
under the terms of this License and subject to the license grants set<br/>
forth in Section 3 below, and any additional terms You may choose to<br/>
offer under Section 6.  You must continue to make the Source Code of<br/>
Your Deployed Modifications available for as long as you Deploy the<br/>
Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial<br/>
Deployment, whichever is longer;<br/>
<br/>
(c) if You Deploy Covered Code containing Modifications made by You,<br/>
inform others of how to obtain those Modifications by filling out and<br/>
submitting the information found at<br/>
http://www.apple.com/publicsource/modifications.html, if available;<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
(d) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only,<br/>
include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related<br/>
documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is<br/>
available under the terms of this License with information on how and<br/>
where to obtain such Source Code.<br/>
<br/>
3. Your Grants.  In consideration of, and as a condition to, the<br/>
licenses granted to You under this License:<br/>
<br/>
(a) You hereby grant to Apple and all third parties a non-exclusive,<br/>
royalty-free license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other<br/>
intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to use,<br/>
reproduce, modify, distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the<br/>
same scope and extent as Apple&apos;s licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2;<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
(b) You hereby grant to Apple and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive,<br/>
worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your<br/>
Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights owned<br/>
or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, execute, compile, display,<br/>
perform, modify or have modified (for Apple and/or its subsidiaries),<br/>
sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form, through<br/>
multiple tiers of distribution.<br/>
<br/>
4. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered<br/>
Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and<br/>
distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In each such<br/>
instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are<br/>
fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.<br/>
<br/>
5. Limitations on Patent License.  Except as expressly stated in<br/>
Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by<br/>
Apple herein.  Modifications and/or Larger Works may require<br/>
additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its<br/>
sole discretion.<br/>
<br/>
6. Additional Terms.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee<br/>
for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or<br/>
other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein<br/>
(&quot;Additional Terms&quot;) to one or more recipients of Covered<br/>
Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole<br/>
responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple. You must obtain the<br/>
recipient&apos;s agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by<br/>
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple<br/>
harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against<br/>
Apple by reason of any such Additional Terms.<br/>
<br/>
7. Versions of the License.  Apple may publish revised and/or new<br/>
versions of this License from time to time.  Each version will be<br/>
given a distinguishing version number.  Once Original Code has been<br/>
published under a particular version of this License, You may continue<br/>
to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use<br/>
such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this<br/>
License published by Apple.  No one other than Apple has the right to<br/>
modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this<br/>
License.<br/>
<br/>
8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT.  The Original Code may contain in whole or<br/>
in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works.  The<br/>
Original Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of<br/>
data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies.  You expressly<br/>
acknowledge and agree that use of the Original Code, or any portion<br/>
thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk.  THE ORIGINAL CODE IS<br/>
PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND<br/>
AND APPLE AND APPLE&apos;S LICENSOR(S) (FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND<br/>
9, APPLE AND APPLE&apos;S LICENSOR(S) ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS<br/>
&quot;APPLE&quot;) EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS<br/>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES<br/>
AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY OR SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND<br/>
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY<br/>
RIGHTS.  APPLE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE<br/>
ORIGINAL CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF<br/>
THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR- FREE, OR THAT<br/>
DEFECTS IN THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL BE CORRECTED.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN<br/>
INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED<br/>
REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE<br/>
SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY.  You acknowledge that the Original Code is not<br/>
intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft<br/>
navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in<br/>
which case the failure of the Original Code could lead to death,<br/>
personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.<br/>
<br/>
9. Liability.<br/>
<br/>
9.1 Infringement.  If any portion of, or functionality implemented by,<br/>
the Original Code becomes the subject of a claim of infringement,<br/>
Apple may, at its option: (a) attempt to procure the rights necessary<br/>
for Apple and You to continue using the Affected Original Code; (b)<br/>
modify the Affected Original Code so that it is no longer infringing;<br/>
or (c) suspend Your rights to use, reproduce, modify, sublicense and<br/>
distribute the Affected Original Code until a final determination of<br/>
the claim is made by a court or governmental administrative agency of<br/>
competent jurisdiction and Apple lifts the suspension as set forth<br/>
below.  Such suspension of rights will be effective immediately upon<br/>
Apple&apos;s posting of a notice to such effect on the Apple web site that<br/>
is used for implementation of this License.  Upon such final<br/>
determination being made, if Apple is legally able, without the<br/>
payment of a fee or royalty, to resume use, reproduction,<br/>
modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Affected Original<br/>
Code, Apple will lift the suspension of rights to the Affected<br/>
Original Code by posting a notice to such effect on the Apple web site<br/>
that is used for implementation of this License.  If Apple suspends<br/>
Your rights to Affected Original Code, nothing in this License shall<br/>
be construed to restrict You, at Your option and subject to applicable<br/>
law, from replacing the Affected Original Code with non-infringing<br/>
code or independently negotiating for necessary rights from such third<br/>
party.<br/>
<br/>
9.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL APPLE BE<br/>
LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES<br/>
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO<br/>
USE THE ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY<br/>
OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY<br/>
OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br/>
SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF<br/>
ANY REMEDY.  In no event shall Apple&apos;s total liability to You for all<br/>
damages under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars<br/>
($50.00).<br/>
<br/>
10. Trademarks.  This License does not grant any rights to use the<br/>
trademarks or trade names &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Apple Computer&quot;, &quot;Mac OS X&quot;, &quot;Mac<br/>
OS X Server&quot; or any other trademarks or trade names belonging to Apple<br/>
(collectively &quot;Apple Marks&quot;) and no Apple Marks may be used to endorse<br/>
or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as<br/>
permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple&apos;s third<br/>
party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at<br/>
http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.<br/>
<br/>
11. Ownership.  Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to<br/>
the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple<br/>
(&quot;Apple Modifications&quot;), and such Apple Modifications will not be<br/>
automatically subject to this License.  Apple may, at its sole<br/>
discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this<br/>
License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or<br/>
may choose not to license them at all.  Apple&apos;s development, use,<br/>
reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of Covered<br/>
Code will not be subject to this License.<br/>
<br/>
12. Termination.<br/>
<br/>
12.1 Termination.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will<br/>
   terminate:<br/>
<br/>
(a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with<br/>
any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30<br/>
days of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of<br/>
the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or (c) automatically<br/>
without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the term of this<br/>
License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple.<br/>
<br/>
12.2 Effect of Termination.  Upon termination, You agree to<br/>
immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification,<br/>
sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all<br/>
copies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control.<br/>
All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted<br/>
prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License.<br/>
Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the<br/>
termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited<br/>
to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13.  Neither party will be<br/>
liable to the other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort<br/>
solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its<br/>
terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to<br/>
any other right or remedy of either party.<br/>
<br/>
13.  Miscellaneous.<br/>
<br/>
13.1 Government End Users.  The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item&quot; as<br/>
defined in FAR 2.101.  Government software and technical data rights<br/>
in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to<br/>
the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial<br/>
license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with<br/>
FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for<br/>
Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data --<br/>
Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer<br/>
Software or Computer Software Documentation).  Accordingly, all U.S.<br/>
Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set<br/>
forth herein.<br/>
<br/>
13.2 Relationship of Parties.  This License will not be construed as<br/>
creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of<br/>
legal association between You and Apple, and You will not represent to<br/>
the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or<br/>
otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
13.3 Independent Development.  Nothing in this License will impair<br/>
Apple&apos;s right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for<br/>
it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the<br/>
same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,<br/>
Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may<br/>
develop, produce, market or distribute.<br/>
<br/>
13.4 Waiver; Construction.  Failure by Apple to enforce any provision<br/>
of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of<br/>
that or any other provision.  Any law or regulation which provides<br/>
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter<br/>
will not apply to this License.<br/>
<br/>
13.5 Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent<br/>
jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof,<br/>
to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to<br/>
the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits<br/>
and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will<br/>
continue in full force and effect.  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,<br/>
if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or<br/>
specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the<br/>
enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will<br/>
immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of<br/>
the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your<br/>
possession or control.<br/>
<br/>
13.6 Dispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute resolution<br/>
between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the<br/>
Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to<br/>
the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal<br/>
courts within that District with respect to this License. The<br/>
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the<br/>
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.<br/>
<br/>
13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law.  This License constitutes the<br/>
entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject<br/>
matter hereof.  This License shall be governed by the laws of the<br/>
United States and the State of California, except that body of<br/>
California law concerning conflicts of law.<br/>
<br/>
Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following<br/>
clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested<br/>
that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les<br/>
parties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents<br/>
connexes soient rediges en anglais.<br/>
