Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal<br/>
<br/>
CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE<br/>
LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN<br/>
ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION<br/>
ON AN &quot;AS-IS&quot; BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE<br/>
USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND<br/>
DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT<br/>
OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.<br/>
<br/>
Statement of Purpose<br/>
<br/>
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer<br/>
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator<br/>
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &quot;owner&quot;) of an original work<br/>
of authorship and/or a database (each, a &quot;Work&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for<br/>
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and<br/>
scientific works (&quot;Commons&quot;) that the public can reliably and without<br/>
fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in<br/>
other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form<br/>
whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial<br/>
purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the<br/>
ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural<br/>
and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for<br/>
their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.<br/>
<br/>
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any<br/>
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person<br/>
associating CC0 with a Work (the &quot;Affirmer&quot;), to the extent that he or<br/>
she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily<br/>
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under<br/>
its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in<br/>
the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those<br/>
rights.<br/>
<br/>
1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be<br/>
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&quot;Copyright and<br/>
Related Rights&quot;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not<br/>
limited to, the following:<br/>
<br/>
i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,<br/>
communicate, and translate a Work;<br/>
<br/>
ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);<br/>
<br/>
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&apos;s image or<br/>
likeness depicted in a Work;<br/>
<br/>
iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,<br/>
subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;<br/>
<br/>
v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of<br/>
data in a Work;<br/>
<br/>
vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of<br/>
the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal<br/>
protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,<br/>
including any amended or successor version of such directive); and<br/>
<br/>
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the<br/>
world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national<br/>
implementations thereof.<br/>
<br/>
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention<br/>
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,<br/>
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of<br/>
Affirmer&apos;s Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes<br/>
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as<br/>
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories<br/>
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or<br/>
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or<br/>
future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose<br/>
whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or<br/>
promotional purposes (the &quot;Waiver&quot;). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the<br/>
benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of<br/>
Affirmer&apos;s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall<br/>
not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or<br/>
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of<br/>
the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer&apos;s express Statement<br/>
of Purpose.<br/>
<br/>
3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason<br/>
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the<br/>
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into<br/>
account Affirmer&apos;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the<br/>
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected<br/>
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non<br/>
exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer&apos;s<br/>
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories<br/>
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or<br/>
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or<br/>
future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose<br/>
whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or<br/>
promotional purposes (the &quot;License&quot;). The License shall be deemed<br/>
effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should<br/>
any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or<br/>
ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or<br/>
ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and<br/>
in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)<br/>
exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the<br/>
Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with<br/>
respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer&apos;s express<br/>
Statement of Purpose.<br/>
<br/>
4. Limitations and Disclaimers.<br/>
<br/>
a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,<br/>
surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.<br/>
<br/>
b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or<br/>
warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory<br/>
or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,<br/>
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or<br/>
the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or<br/>
absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest<br/>
extent permissible under applicable law.<br/>
<br/>
c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other<br/>
persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without<br/>
limitation any person&apos;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.<br/>
Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary<br/>
consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.<br/>
<br/>
d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a<br/>
party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to<br/>
this CC0 or use of the Work.
