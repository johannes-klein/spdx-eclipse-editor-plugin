  Academic Free License<br/>
  Version 1.2 <br/>
<br/>
This Academic Free License applies to any original work of authorship <br/>
(the &quot;Original Work&quot;) whose owner (the &quot;Licensor&quot;) has placed the <br/>
following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the <br/>
Original Work:<br/>
<br/>
Licensed under the Academic Free License version 1.2 <br/>
<br/>
Grant of License. Licensor hereby grants to any person obtaining a <br/>
copy of the Original Work (&quot;You&quot;) a world-wide, royalty-free, <br/>
non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable license (1) to use, copy, <br/>
modify, merge, publish, perform, distribute and/or sell copies of the <br/>
Original Work and derivative works thereof, and (2) under patent claims <br/>
owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original <br/>
Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for <br/>
sale the Original Work and derivative works thereof, subject to the <br/>
following conditions.<br/>
<br/>
Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any <br/>
Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark <br/>
notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any <br/>
notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an <br/>
&quot;Attribution Notice.&quot; You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative <br/>
Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably <br/>
calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.<br/>
<br/>
Exclusions from License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the <br/>
names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their <br/>
trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products <br/>
derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission <br/>
of the Licensor.<br/>
<br/>
Warranty and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright <br/>
in and to the Original Work is owned by the Licensor or that the Original <br/>
Work is distributed by Licensor under a valid current license from the <br/>
copyright owner. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding <br/>
sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an &quot;AS IS&quot; <br/>
BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without <br/>
limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS <br/>
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL <br/>
WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part <br/>
of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except <br/>
under this disclaimer.<br/>
<br/>
Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, <br/>
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the <br/>
Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, <br/>
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result <br/>
of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without <br/>
limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure <br/>
or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This <br/>
limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal <br/>
injury resulting from Licensor&apos;s negligence to the extent applicable law <br/>
prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or <br/>
limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and <br/>
limitation may not apply to You.<br/>
<br/>
License to Source Code. The term &quot;Source Code&quot; means the preferred form of <br/>
the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available <br/>
documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby <br/>
agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original <br/>
Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. <br/>
Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a <br/>
machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository <br/>
reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for <br/>
as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by <br/>
publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately <br/>
following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.<br/>
<br/>
Mutual Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate <br/>
automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You <br/>
by this License if You file a lawsuit in any court alleging that any OSI <br/>
Certified open source software that is licensed under any license containing <br/>
this &quot;Mutual Termination for Patent Action&quot; clause infringes any patent <br/>
claims that are essential to use that software.<br/>
<br/>
Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise <br/>
restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises <br/>
not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.<br/>
<br/>
This license is Copyright (C) 2002 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights reserved. <br/>
Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without <br/>
modification. This license may not be modified without the express written <br/>
permission of its copyright owner.
