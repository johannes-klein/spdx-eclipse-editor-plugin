LaTeX Project Public License<br/>
============================<br/>
 <br/>
LPPL Version 1.0  1999-03-01<br/>
<br/>
Copyright 1999 LaTeX3 Project<br/>
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>
    of this license document, but modification is not allowed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Preamble<br/>
========<br/>
<br/>
The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the<br/>
base LaTeX distribution is distributed. As described below you may use<br/>
this licence for any software that you wish to distribute. <br/>
<br/>
It may be particularly suitable if your software is TeX related (such<br/>
as a LaTeX package file) but it may be used for any software, even if<br/>
it is unrelated to TeX.<br/>
<br/>
To use this license, the files of your distribution should have an<br/>
explicit copyright notice giving your name and the year, together<br/>
with a reference to this license.<br/>
<br/>
A typical example would be<br/>
<br/>
   %% pig.sty<br/>
   %% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name<br/>
<br/>
   % This program can redistributed and/or modified under the terms<br/>
   % of the LaTeX Project Public License Distributed from CTAN<br/>
   % archives in directory macros/latex/base/lppl.txt; either<br/>
   % version 1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br/>
<br/>
Given such a notice in the file, the conditions of this document would<br/>
apply, with:<br/>
<br/>
`The Program&apos; referring to the software `pig.sty&apos;  and <br/>
`The Copyright Holder&apos; referring to the person `M. Y. Name&apos;.<br/>
<br/>
To see a real example, see the file legal.txt which carries the<br/>
copyright notice for the base latex distribution.<br/>
<br/>
This license gives terms under which files of The Program may be<br/>
distributed and modified. Individual files may have specific further<br/>
constraints on modification, but no file should have restrictions on<br/>
distribution other than those specified below. <br/>
This is to ensure that a distributor wishing to distribute a complete<br/>
unmodified copy of The Program need only check the conditions in this<br/>
file, and does not need to check every file in The Program for extra<br/>
restrictions. If you do need to modify the distribution terms of some<br/>
files, do not refer to this license, instead distribute The Program<br/>
under a different license. You may use the parts of the text of LPPL as<br/>
a model for your own license, but your license should not directly refer<br/>
to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that The Program is<br/>
distributed under the LPPL. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The LaTeX Project Public License<br/>
================================<br/>
Terms And Conditions For Copying, Distribution And Modification<br/>
===============================================================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WARRANTY<br/>
========<br/>
<br/>
There is no warranty for The Program, to the extent permitted by<br/>
applicable law.  Except when otherwise stated in writing, The<br/>
Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is&apos; without warranty of any<br/>
kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the<br/>
implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular<br/>
purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the<br/>
program is with you.  Should The Program prove defective, you assume<br/>
the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.<br/>
<br/>
In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing<br/>
will The Copyright Holder, or any of the individual authors named in<br/>
the source for The Program, be liable to you for damages, including<br/>
any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out<br/>
of any use of The Program or out of inability to use The Program<br/>
(including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered<br/>
inaccurate or losses sustained by you or by third parties as a result<br/>
of a failure of The Program to operate with any other programs), even<br/>
if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of<br/>
such damages.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DISTRIBUTION<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
Redistribution of unchanged files is allowed provided that all files<br/>
that make up the distribution of The Program are distributed.<br/>
In particular this means that The Program has to be distributed<br/>
including its documentation if documentation was part of the original<br/>
distribution.<br/>
<br/>
The distribution of The Program will contain a prominent file<br/>
listing all the files covered by this license.<br/>
<br/>
If you receive only some of these files from someone, complain!<br/>
<br/>
The distribution of changed versions of certain files included in the<br/>
The Program, and the reuse of code from The Program, are allowed<br/>
under the following restrictions:<br/>
<br/>
 * It is allowed only if the legal notice in the file does not<br/>
   expressly forbid it.<br/>
   See note below, under &quot;Conditions on individual files&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
 * You rename the file before you make any changes to it, unless the<br/>
   file explicitly says that renaming is not required.  Any such changed<br/>
   files must be distributed under a license that forbids distribution<br/>
   of those files, and any files derived from them, under the names used<br/>
   by the original files in the distribution of The Program.<br/>
<br/>
 * You change any `identification string&apos; in The Program to clearly <br/>
   indicate that the file is not part of the standard system.<br/>
<br/>
 * If The Program includes an `error report address&apos; so that errors<br/>
   may be reported to The Copyright Holder, or other specified<br/>
   addresses, this address must be changed in any modified versions of<br/>
   The Program, so that reports for files not maintained by the<br/>
   original program maintainers are directed to the maintainers of the<br/>
   changed files. <br/>
<br/>
 * You acknowledge the source and authorship of the original version<br/>
   in the modified file.<br/>
<br/>
 * You also distribute the unmodified version of the file or<br/>
   alternatively provide sufficient information so that the<br/>
   user of your modified file can be reasonably expected to be<br/>
   able to obtain an original, unmodified copy of The Program.<br/>
   For example, you may specify a URL to a site that you expect<br/>
   will freely provide the user with a copy of The Program (either<br/>
   the version on which your modification is based, or perhaps a<br/>
   later version).<br/>
<br/>
 * If The Program is intended to be used with, or is based on, LaTeX,<br/>
   then files with the following file extensions which have special<br/>
   meaning in LaTeX Software, have special modification rules under the<br/>
   license:<br/>
 <br/>
    - Files with extension `.ins&apos; (installation files): these files may<br/>
      not be modified at all because they contain the legal notices<br/>
      that are placed in the generated files.<br/>
 <br/>
    - Files with extension `.fd&apos; (LaTeX font definitions files): these<br/>
      files are allowed to be modified without changing the name, but<br/>
      only to enable use of all available fonts and to prevent attempts<br/>
      to access unavailable fonts. However, modified files are not<br/>
      allowed to be distributed in place of original files.<br/>
 <br/>
    - Files with extension `.cfg&apos; (configuration files): these files<br/>
      can be created or modified to enable easy configuration of the<br/>
      system.  The documentation in cfgguide.tex in the base LaTeX<br/>
      distribution describes when it makes sense to modify or generate<br/>
      such files.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The above restrictions are not intended to prohibit, and hence do<br/>
not apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it<br/>
becomes identical to the latest version of that file in The Program.<br/>
<br/>
========================================================================<br/>
<br/>
NOTES<br/>
=====<br/>
<br/>
We believe that these requirements give you the freedom you to make<br/>
modifications that conform with whatever technical specifications you<br/>
wish, whilst maintaining the availability, integrity and reliability of<br/>
The Program.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal whilst<br/>
adhering to these requirements then read the document cfgguide.tex<br/>
in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions. <br/>
<br/>
Because of the portability and exchangeability aspects of systems<br/>
like LaTeX, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of<br/>
non-standard versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available<br/>
contributed code for them but such distributions are permitted under the<br/>
above restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
The document modguide.tex in the base LaTeX distribution details<br/>
the reasons for the legal requirements detailed above.<br/>
Even if The Program is unrelated to LaTeX, the argument in<br/>
modguide.tex may still apply, and should be read before<br/>
a modified version of The Program is distributed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Conditions on individual files<br/>
==============================<br/>
<br/>
The individual files may bear additional conditions which supersede<br/>
the general conditions on distribution and modification contained in<br/>
this file. If there are any such files, the distribution of The<br/>
Program will contain a prominent file that lists all the exceptional<br/>
files.<br/>
<br/>
Typical examples of files with more restrictive modification<br/>
conditions would be files that contain the text of copyright notices.<br/>
<br/>
 * The conditions on individual files differ only in the<br/>
   extent of *modification* that is allowed.<br/>
<br/>
 * The conditions on *distribution* are the same for all the files.<br/>
   Thus a (re)distributor of a complete, unchanged copy of The Program<br/>
   need meet only the conditions in this file; it is not necessary to<br/>
   check the header of every file in the distribution to check that a<br/>
   distribution meets these requirements.
