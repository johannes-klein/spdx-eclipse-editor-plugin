Reciprocal Public License 1.5 (RPL1.5)<br/>
<br/>
Version 1.5, July 15, 2007<br/>
<br/>
Copyright (C) 2001-2007<br/>
Technical Pursuit Inc.,<br/>
All Rights Reserved.<br/>
<br/>
PREAMBLE<br/>
<br/>
The Reciprocal Public License (RPL) is based on the concept of reciprocity or,<br/>
if you prefer, fairness.<br/>
<br/>
In short, this license grew out of a desire to close loopholes in previous open<br/>
source licenses, loopholes that allowed parties to acquire open source software<br/>
and derive financial benefit from it without having to release their<br/>
improvements or derivatives to the community which enabled them. This occurred<br/>
any time an entity did not release their application to a &quot;third party&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
While there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing, it struck the<br/>
authors of the RPL as being unfair to the open source community at large and to<br/>
the original authors of the works in particular. After all, bug fixes,<br/>
extensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were not consistently<br/>
finding their way back into the community where they could fuel further, and<br/>
faster, growth and expansion of the overall open source software base.<br/>
<br/>
While you should clearly read and understand the entire license, the essence of<br/>
the RPL is found in two definitions: &quot;Deploy&quot; and &quot;Required Components&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding deployment, under the RPL your changes, bug fixes, extensions, etc.<br/>
must be made available to the open source community at large when you Deploy in<br/>
any form -- either internally or to an outside party. Once you start running<br/>
the software you have to start sharing the software.<br/>
<br/>
Further, under the RPL all components you author including schemas, scripts,<br/>
source code, etc. -- regardless of whether they&apos;re compiled into a single<br/>
binary or used as two halves of client/server application -- must be shared.<br/>
You have to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice of it.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to these goals, the RPL was authored to meet the requirements of<br/>
the Open Source Definition as maintained by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).<br/>
<br/>
The specific terms and conditions of the license are defined in the remainder<br/>
of this document.<br/>

intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each<br/>
Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other<br/>
entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As<br/>
a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You<br/>
hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property<br/>
rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is<br/>
required to allow You to distribute the Licensed Software, it is Your<br/>
responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed<br/>
Software.<br/>
<br/>
6.0 Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express<br/>
condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License You hereby agree<br/>
that any Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components (collectively<br/>
Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the<br/>
terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any Extensions<br/>
that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of<br/>
this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You<br/>
hereby grant to Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive,<br/>
royalty-free license under those intellectual property rights You own or<br/>
control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivatives,<br/>
sublicense, and distribute Licensed Software, in any form. Any Extensions You<br/>
make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any<br/>
subsequent user or Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must<br/>
include a copy of this License or directions on how to obtain a copy with<br/>
every copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose<br/>
any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software,<br/>
or its Extensions that alter or restrict the applicable version of this<br/>
License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder.<br/>
<br/>
6.1 Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of<br/>
this License, the Source Code of any Extensions that You Deploy, via an<br/>
Electronic Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version that You<br/>
Deploy must be made available within one (1) month of when you Deploy and must<br/>
remain available for no less than twelve (12) months after the date You cease<br/>
to Deploy. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code to each<br/>
version You Deploy remains available even if the Electronic Distribution<br/>
Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may not charge a fee for any<br/>
copy of the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess of Your<br/>
actual cost of duplication and distribution of said copy.<br/>
<br/>
6.2 Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You<br/>
create or to which You contribute to be documented in the Source Code, clearly<br/>
describing the additions, changes or deletions You made. You must include a<br/>
prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly,<br/>
from the Licensed Software and include the names of the Licensor and any<br/>
Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any<br/>
notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related<br/>
documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed<br/>
Software. You may not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices,<br/>
change notices or License text in the Licensed Software without written<br/>
permission of the respective Licensor or Contributor.<br/>
<br/>
6.3 Intellectual Property Matters.<br/>
<br/>
a. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&apos;s<br/>
intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this<br/>
License, You must include a human-readable file with Your distribution that<br/>
describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a<br/>
recipient will know whom to contact.<br/>
<br/>
b. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming<br/>
interface (&quot;API&quot;) and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are<br/>
reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this<br/>
information in a human-readable file supplied with Your distribution.<br/>
<br/>
c. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a)<br/>
above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original<br/>
creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by<br/>
this License.<br/>
<br/>
6.4 Required Notices.<br/>
<br/>
a. License Text. You must duplicate this License or instructions on how to<br/>
acquire a copy in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of<br/>
any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe<br/>
recipients&apos; rights relating to Licensed Software.<br/>
<br/>
b. License Notice. You must duplicate any notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the<br/>
&quot;License Notice&quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute<br/>
of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You<br/>
may add Your name as a Contributor to the Source Code and accompanying<br/>
documentation along with a description of the contribution. If it is not<br/>
possible to put the License Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its<br/>
structure, then You must include such License Notice in a location where a<br/>
user would be likely to look for such a notice.<br/>
<br/>
c. Source Code Availability. You must notify the software community of the<br/>
availability of Source Code to Your Extensions within one (1) month of the date<br/>
You initially Deploy and include in such notification a description of the<br/>
Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code. Should such<br/>
instructions change you must notify the software community of revised<br/>
instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. You must provide<br/>
notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, weblogs, or<br/>
other sites where a publicly accessible search engine would reasonably be<br/>
expected to index your post in relationship to queries regarding the Licensed<br/>
Software and/or Your Extensions.<br/>
<br/>
d. User-Visible Attribution. You must duplicate any notice contained in<br/>
EXHIBIT B (the &quot;User-Visible Attribution Notice&quot;) in each user-visible display<br/>
of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions which delineates copyright,<br/>
ownership, or similar attribution information. If You create an Extension,<br/>
You may add Your name as a Contributor, and add Your attribution notice, as an<br/>
equally visible and functional element of any User-Visible Attribution Notice<br/>
content. To ensure proper attribution, You must also include such User-Visible<br/>
Attribution Notice in at least one location in the Software documentation<br/>
where a user would be likely to look for such notice.<br/>
<br/>
6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty,<br/>
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of<br/>
Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br/>
behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor except as permitted under other<br/>
agreements between you and Licensor or Contributor. You must make it clear that<br/>
any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You<br/>
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for<br/>
any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such<br/>
action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of<br/>
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br/>
<br/>
6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by<br/>
virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance,<br/>
fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be<br/>
honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this<br/>
License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of<br/>
the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the<br/>
conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License.<br/>
Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.<br/>
<br/>
7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised<br/>
versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a<br/>
particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the<br/>
terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Software under<br/>
the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No<br/>
one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to<br/>
Licensed Software created under this License.<br/>
<br/>
7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do<br/>
only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software<br/>
under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly<br/>
similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains<br/>
terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not<br/>
use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications<br/>
to this License be limited to alteration of a) Section 13.8 solely to modify<br/>
the legal Jurisdiction or Venue for disputes, b) EXHIBIT A solely to define<br/>
License Notice text, or c) to EXHIBIT B solely to define a User-Visible<br/>
Attribution Notice, You may continue to refer to Your License as the<br/>
Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.<br/>
<br/>

LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS<br/>
DISCLAIMER.<br/>
<br/>
9.0 Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,<br/>
WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE<br/>
LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED SOFTWARE, OR ANY<br/>
SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,<br/>
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,<br/>
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER<br/>
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,<br/>
EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br/>
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH<br/>
OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT<br/>
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br/>
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS<br/>
EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br/>
<br/>
10.0 High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS<br/>
NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE<br/>
CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE,<br/>
SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR<br/>
COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, OR<br/>
WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD<br/>
DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE<br/>
(&quot;HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES&quot;). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY<br/>
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.<br/>
<br/>
11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each<br/>
party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,<br/>
out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically<br/>
disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph<br/>
is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of<br/>
Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the<br/>
disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor<br/>
has thereby disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or<br/>
may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to<br/>
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms<br/>
of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or<br/>
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<br/>
<br/>
12.0 Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate<br/>
immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if<br/>
applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically<br/>
complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of any<br/>
of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed<br/>
Software.<br/>
<br/>
12.1 Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted<br/>
hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with the terms<br/>
herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware<br/>
of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software that are properly<br/>
granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by<br/>
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License,<br/>
shall survive.<br/>
<br/>
12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate<br/>
litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory<br/>
judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor<br/>
against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as &quot;Respondent&quot;)<br/>
alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent,<br/>
then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or<br/>
4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice<br/>
from Respondent (the &quot;Notice Period&quot;) unless within that Notice Period You<br/>
either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably<br/>
royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such<br/>
Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed<br/>
Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable<br/>
royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the<br/>
parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by<br/>
Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the<br/>
expiration of said Notice Period.<br/>
<br/>
12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement<br/>
claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or<br/>
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by<br/>
license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement<br/>
litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said<br/>
Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining<br/>
the amount or value of any payment or license.<br/>
<br/>
12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under<br/>
this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to<br/>
distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any<br/>
distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.<br/>
<br/>
13.0 Miscellaneous.<br/>
<br/>
13.1 U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Software is a &quot;commercial item,&quot;<br/>
as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of<br/>
&quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software<br/>
documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).<br/>
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4<br/>
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Software with only<br/>
those rights set forth herein.<br/>
<br/>
13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating<br/>
an agency, partnership, joint venture, or any other form of legal association<br/>
between or among You, Licensor, or any Contributor, and You will not represent<br/>
to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance, or otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor&apos;s<br/>
right to acquire, license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute<br/>
technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or<br/>
otherwise compete with, Extensions that You may develop, produce, market, or<br/>
distribute.<br/>
<br/>
13.4 Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to<br/>
enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement<br/>
of that or any other provision.<br/>
<br/>
13.5 Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning<br/>
the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br/>
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary<br/>
to make it enforceable.<br/>
<br/>
13.6 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for<br/>
You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or<br/>
all of the Licensed Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation,<br/>
then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the software.<br/>
<br/>
13.7 Export Restrictions. You may be restricted with respect to downloading or<br/>
otherwise acquiring, exporting, or reexporting the Licensed Software or any<br/>
underlying information or technology by United States and other applicable<br/>
laws and regulations. By downloading or by otherwise obtaining the Licensed<br/>
Software, You are agreeing to be responsible for compliance with all<br/>
applicable laws and regulations.<br/>
<br/>
13.8 Arbitration, Jurisdiction &amp; Venue. This License shall be governed by<br/>
Colorado law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides<br/>
otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that<br/>
any dispute relating to this License shall be submitted to binding arbitration<br/>
under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association. You<br/>
further agree that Adams County, Colorado USA is proper venue and grant such<br/>
arbitration proceeding jurisdiction as may be appropriate for purposes of<br/>
resolving any dispute under this License. Judgement upon any award made in<br/>
arbitration may be entered and enforced in any court of competent<br/>
jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award attorney&apos;s fees and costs of<br/>
arbitration to the prevailing party. Should either party find it necessary to<br/>
enforce its arbitration award or seek specific performance of such award in a<br/>
civil court of competent jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitled<br/>
to reasonable attorney&apos;s fees and costs. The application of the United Nations<br/>
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly<br/>
excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any<br/>
litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License. Any law or regulation<br/>
that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the<br/>
drafter shall not apply to this License.<br/>
<br/>
13.9 Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement between<br/>
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.<br/>
