and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on<br/>
the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a<br/>
world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of<br/>
Apple&apos;s Applicable Patents and copyrights covering the Original<br/>
Code, to do the following:<br/>
<br/>
2.1 You may use, copy, modify and distribute Original Code, with or<br/>
without Modifications, solely for Your internal research and<br/>
development, provided that You must in each instance:<br/>
<br/>
(a) retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright<br/>
and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear<br/>
in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code<br/>
that refer to this License;<br/>
<br/>
(b) include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of<br/>
Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer<br/>
or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this<br/>
License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder, except as permitted under<br/>
Section 6; and<br/>
<br/>
(c) completely and accurately document all Modifications that you have<br/>
made and the date of each such Modification, designate the version of<br/>
the Original Code you used, prominently include a file carrying such<br/>
information with the Modifications, and duplicate the notice in<br/>
Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all such Modifications.<br/>
<br/>
2.2 You may Deploy Covered Code, provided that You must in each<br/>
instance:<br/>
<br/>
(a) satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the<br/>
Source Code of the Covered Code;<br/>
<br/>
(b) make all Your Deployed Modifications publicly available in Source<br/>
Code form via electronic distribution (e.g. download from a web site)<br/>
under the terms of this License and subject to the license grants set<br/>
forth in Section 3 below, and any additional terms You may choose to<br/>
offer under Section 6. You must continue to make the Source Code of<br/>
Your Deployed Modifications available for as long as you Deploy the<br/>
Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial<br/>
Deployment, whichever is longer;<br/>
<br/>
(c) must notify Apple and other third parties of how to obtain Your<br/>
Deployed Modifications by filling out and submitting the required<br/>
information found at<br/>
http://www.apple.com/publicsource/modifications.html; and<br/>
<br/>
(d) if you Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only,<br/>
include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related<br/>
documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is<br/>
available under the terms of this License with information on how and<br/>
where to obtain such Source Code.<br/>
<br/>
3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the<br/>
licenses granted to You under this License:<br/>
<br/>
(a) You hereby grant to Apple and all third parties a non-exclusive,<br/>
royalty-free license, under Your Applicable Patents and other<br/>
intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to use,<br/>
reproduce, modify, distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the<br/>
same scope and extent as Apple&apos;s licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2;<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
(b) You hereby grant to Apple and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive,<br/>
worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your<br/>
Applicable Patents and other intellectual property rights owned or<br/>
controlled by You, to use, reproduce, execute, compile, display,<br/>
perform, modify or have modified (for Apple and/or its subsidiaries),<br/>
sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form, through<br/>
multiple tiers of distribution.<br/>
<br/>
4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered<br/>
Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and<br/>
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such<br/>
instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are<br/>
fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.<br/>
<br/>
5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in<br/>
Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted<br/>
by Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require<br/>
additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its<br/>
sole discretion.<br/>
<br/>
6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee<br/>
for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or<br/>
other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein<br/>
(&quot;Additional Terms&quot;) to one or more recipients of Covered<br/>
Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your<br/>
sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple. You must obtain the<br/>
recipient&apos;s agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by<br/>
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple<br/>
harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against<br/>
Apple by reason of any such Additional Terms.<br/>
<br/>
7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new<br/>
versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be<br/>
given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been<br/>
published under a particular version of this License, You may<br/>
continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also<br/>
choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent<br/>
version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple<br/>
has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created<br/>
under this License.<br/>
<br/>
8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Original Code may contain in whole or<br/>
in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The<br/>
Original Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss<br/>
of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You<br/>
expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Original Code, or<br/>
any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE ORIGINAL<br/>
CODE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT<br/>
OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE&apos;S LICENSOR(S) (FOR THE PURPOSES OF<br/>
SECTIONS 8 AND 9, APPLE AND APPLE&apos;S LICENSOR(S) ARE COLLECTIVELY<br/>
REFERRED TO AS &quot;APPLE&quot;) EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR<br/>
CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br/>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY OR<br/>
SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND<br/>
NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT<br/>
THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL MEET YOUR<br/>
REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL BE<br/>
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE ORIGINAL CODE<br/>
WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN<br/>
BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A<br/>
WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY. You<br/>
acknowledge that the Original Code is not intended for use in the<br/>
operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication<br/>
systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure<br/>
of the Original Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe<br/>
physical or environmental damage.<br/>
<br/>
9. Liability.<br/>
<br/>
9.1 Infringement. If any of the Original Code becomes the subject of<br/>
a claim of infringement (&quot;Affected Original Code&quot;), Apple may, at<br/>
its sole discretion and option: (a) attempt to procure the rights<br/>
necessary for You to continue using the Affected Original Code; (b)<br/>
modify the Affected Original Code so that it is no longer<br/>
infringing; or (c) terminate Your rights to use the Affected<br/>
Original Code, effective immediately upon Apple&apos;s posting of a<br/>
notice to such effect on the Apple web site that is used for<br/>
implementation of this License.<br/>
<br/>
9.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL APPLE BE<br/>
LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL<br/>
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR<br/>
INABILITY TO USE THE ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER<br/>
UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),<br/>
PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF<br/>
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF<br/>
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. In no event shall Apple&apos;s total<br/>
liability to You for all damages under this License exceed the<br/>
amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).<br/>
<br/>
10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the<br/>
trademarks or trade names &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Apple Computer&quot;, &quot;Mac OS X&quot;,<br/>
&quot;Mac OS X Server&quot; or any other trademarks or trade names belonging<br/>
to Apple (collectively &quot;Apple Marks&quot;) and no Apple Marks may be<br/>
used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code<br/>
other than as permitted by and in strict compliance at all times<br/>
with Apple&apos;s third party trademark usage guidelines which are<br/>
posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.<br/>
<br/>
11. Ownership. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to<br/>
the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of<br/>
Apple (&quot;Apple Modifications&quot;), and such Apple Modifications will<br/>
not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its<br/>
sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under<br/>
this License, or on different terms from those contained in this<br/>
License or may choose not to license them at all. Apple&apos;s<br/>
development, use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and<br/>
distribution of Covered Code will not be subject to this License.<br/>
<br/>
12. Termination.<br/>
<br/>
12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will<br/>
terminate:<br/>
<br/>
(a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with<br/>
any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30<br/>
days of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of<br/>
the circumstances described in Sections 9.1 and/or 13.6(b); or (c)<br/>
automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the<br/>
term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement<br/>
against Apple.<br/>
<br/>
12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to<br/>
immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification and<br/>
distribution of the Covered Code, or Affected Original Code in the<br/>
case of termination under Section 9.1, and to destroy all copies of<br/>
the Covered Code or Affected Original Code (in the case of<br/>
termination under Section 9.1) that are in your possession or<br/>
control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been<br/>
properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination<br/>
of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain<br/>
in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive,<br/>
including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and<br/>
13. Neither party will be liable to the other for compensation,<br/>
indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating<br/>
this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this<br/>
License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of<br/>
either party.<br/>
<br/>
13. Miscellaneous.<br/>
<br/>
13.1 Export Law Assurances. You may not use or otherwise export or<br/>
re-export the Original Code except as authorized by United States<br/>
law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Original Code was<br/>
obtained. In particular, but without limitation, the Original Code<br/>
may not be exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a national or<br/>
resident of) any U.S. embargoed country or (b) to anyone on the<br/>
U.S. Treasury Department&apos;s list of Specially Designated Nationals<br/>
or the U.S. Department of Commerce&apos;s Table of Denial Orders. By<br/>
using the Original Code, You represent and warrant that You are not<br/>
located in, under control of, or a national or resident of any such<br/>
country or on any such list.<br/>
<br/>
13.2 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item&quot; as<br/>
defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data<br/>
rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily<br/>
provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary<br/>
commercial license in technical data and software is provided in<br/>
accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer<br/>
Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR<br/>
252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3<br/>
(Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software<br/>
Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire<br/>
Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.<br/>
<br/>
13.3 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as<br/>
creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of<br/>
legal association between You and Apple, and You will not represent<br/>
to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or<br/>
otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
13.4 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair<br/>
Apple&apos;s right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for<br/>
it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform<br/>
the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,<br/>
Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may<br/>
develop, produce, market or distribute.<br/>
<br/>
13.5 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple to enforce any provision<br/>
of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement<br/>
of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which<br/>
provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against<br/>
the drafter will not apply to this License.<br/>
<br/>
13.6 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent<br/>
jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion<br/>
thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be<br/>
enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the<br/>
economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of<br/>
this License will continue in full force and effect. (b)<br/>
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or<br/>
restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with<br/>
Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of<br/>
those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You<br/>
must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and<br/>
destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.<br/>
<br/>
13.7 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution<br/>
between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in<br/>
the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby<br/>
consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state<br/>
and federal courts within that District with respect to this<br/>
License. The application of the United Nations Convention on<br/>
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly<br/>
excluded.<br/>
<br/>
13.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the<br/>
entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject<br/>
matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the<br/>
United States and the State of California, except that body of<br/>
California law concerning conflicts of law.<br/>
<br/>
Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following<br/>
clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested<br/>
that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les<br/>
parties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents<br/>
connexes soient rediges en anglais.<br/>
