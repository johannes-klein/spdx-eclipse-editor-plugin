LPPL Version 1.3c  2008-05-04<br/>
<br/>
Copyright 1999 2002-2008 LaTeX3 Project<br/>
    Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this<br/>
    license document, but modification of it is not allowed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PREAMBLE<br/>
========<br/>
<br/>
The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under<br/>
which the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.<br/>
<br/>
You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright<br/>
and which you wish to distribute.  This license may be particularly<br/>
suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but <br/>
it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is <br/>
unrelated to TeX.<br/>
<br/>
The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE&apos;,<br/>
below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors<br/>
who are considering distributing their works under this license.<br/>
<br/>
This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed<br/>
and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of<br/>
that work may be distributed.<br/>
<br/>
We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you<br/>
the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work<br/>
that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while<br/>
maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of<br/>
that work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while<br/>
meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex&apos;<br/>
and `modguide.tex&apos; in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DEFINITIONS<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
In this license document the following terms are used:<br/>
<br/>
   `Work&apos;<br/>
    Any work being distributed under this License.<br/>
    <br/>
   `Derived Work&apos;<br/>
    Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.<br/>
<br/>
   `Modification&apos; <br/>
    Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable<br/>
    law -- for example, the production of a file containing an<br/>
    original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of<br/>
    such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or<br/>
    translated into another language.<br/>
<br/>
   `Modify&apos;<br/>
    To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any<br/>
    applicable law.<br/>
    <br/>
   `Distribution&apos;<br/>
    Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in<br/>
    whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)<br/>
    making any electronic components of the Work accessible by<br/>
    file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file<br/>
    systems such as Sun&apos;s Network File System (NFS).<br/>
<br/>
   `Compiled Work&apos;<br/>
    A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it<br/>
    is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may<br/>
    include using installation facilities provided by the Work,<br/>
    transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or<br/>
    other activities.  Note that modification of any installation<br/>
    facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.<br/>
<br/>
   `Current Maintainer&apos;<br/>
    A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is<br/>
    no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder&apos; under<br/>
    any applicable law.<br/>
<br/>
   `Base Interpreter&apos; <br/>
    A program or process that is normally needed for running or<br/>
    interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.    <br/>
<br/>
    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these<br/>
    are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each<br/>
    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used<br/>
    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the<br/>
    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a<br/>
    `LaTeX-Format&apos; or in the case of files belonging to the <br/>
    `LaTeX-format&apos; a program implementing the `TeX language&apos;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br/>
===========================================<br/>
<br/>
1.  Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work<br/>
are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In<br/>
particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no<br/>
requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.<br/>
<br/>
2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you<br/>
received it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered<br/>
modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived<br/>
Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.<br/>
<br/>
3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a<br/>
complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2<br/>
above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that<br/>
the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly<br/>
as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work<br/>
directly from the Work.<br/>
<br/>
4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without<br/>
restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may<br/>
also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including<br/>
Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works<br/>
distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to<br/>
be updated versions of the Work.<br/>
<br/>
5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify<br/>
your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,<br/>
and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on<br/>
the Derived Work.<br/>
<br/>
6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may<br/>
distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met<br/>
for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states<br/>
in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only<br/>
the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption <br/>
to a component of the Work. <br/>
<br/>
  a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement<br/>
     for a component of the Work when that component is used with the<br/>
     Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work<br/>
     identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that<br/>
     Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work<br/>
     clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version<br/>
     of this component to the user when used interactively with that<br/>
     Base Interpreter.<br/>
     <br/>
  b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices<br/>
     detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a<br/>
     prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part<br/>
     of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log<br/>
     of the changes.<br/>
  <br/>
  c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,<br/>
     including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version<br/>
     of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)<br/>
     the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the<br/>
     Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that<br/>
     they do provide such support for the Derived Work.<br/>
<br/>
  d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:<br/>
<br/>
       1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; <br/>
          if your distribution of a modified component is made by<br/>
          offering access to copy the modified component from a<br/>
          designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy<br/>
          the Work from the same or some similar place meets this<br/>
          condition, even though third parties are not compelled to<br/>
          copy the Work along with the modified component;<br/>
<br/>
       2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,<br/>
          unmodified copy of the Work.<br/>
<br/>
7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may<br/>
distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as<br/>
the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled<br/>
Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with<br/>
regard to the Derived Work.<br/>
<br/>
8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not<br/>
apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it<br/>
becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as<br/>
it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.<br/>
<br/>
9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative<br/>
format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is<br/>
then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or<br/>
nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of<br/>
applying that process.<br/>
     <br/>
10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license<br/>
       provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in<br/>
       Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have<br/>
       to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.<br/>
      <br/>
    b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that<br/>
       Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of<br/>
       itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the <br/>
       restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.<br/>
<br/>
11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to<br/>
the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating<br/>
such works with the Work by any means.<br/>
<br/>
12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent<br/>
complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
NO WARRANTY<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
There is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in<br/>
writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is&apos;, without<br/>
warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not<br/>
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a<br/>
particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance<br/>
of the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you assume<br/>
the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.<br/>
<br/>
In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing<br/>
will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the<br/>
Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as<br/>
permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,<br/>
special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of<br/>
the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited<br/>
to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by<br/>
anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other<br/>
programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other<br/>
party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK<br/>
=======================<br/>
<br/>
The Work has the status `author-maintained&apos; if the Copyright Holder<br/>
explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in<br/>
the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder<br/>
or simply that it is `author-maintained&apos;.<br/>
<br/>
The Work has the status `maintained&apos; if there is a Current Maintainer<br/>
who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error<br/>
reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail<br/>
address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge<br/>
or act upon these error reports.<br/>
<br/>
The Work changes from status `maintained&apos; to `unmaintained&apos; if there<br/>
is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current<br/>
Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means<br/>
of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other<br/>
significant signs of active maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with<br/>
any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.<br/>
<br/>
If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of<br/>
the Work through the following steps:<br/>
<br/>
 1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and<br/>
     the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of<br/>
     an Internet or similar search.<br/>
<br/>
 2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work<br/>
     is still maintained.<br/>
<br/>
  a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer<br/>
     to update their communication data within one month.<br/>
     <br/>
  b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active<br/>
     maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce<br/>
     within the pertinent community your intention to take over<br/>
     maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be<br/>
     done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)<br/>
<br/>
 3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass<br/>
     maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect<br/>
     immediately upon announcement.<br/>
     <br/>
  b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright<br/>
     Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,<br/>
     then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.  <br/>
    <br/>
 4.  If you make an `intention announcement&apos; as described in 2b. above<br/>
     and after three months your intention is challenged neither by<br/>
     the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other<br/>
     people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as<br/>
     to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.<br/>
     <br/>
 5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes<br/>
     reachable once more within three months of a change completed<br/>
     under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must<br/>
     become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided<br/>
     they then update their communication data within one month.<br/>
<br/>
A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact<br/>
that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.<br/>
<br/>
If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should<br/>
immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous<br/>
statement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also<br/>
announce your new status to the same pertinent community as<br/>
in 2b) above.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE<br/>
======================================================<br/>
<br/>
This section contains important instructions, examples, and<br/>
recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their<br/>
works under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you&apos; in<br/>
this section.<br/>
<br/>
Choosing This License or Another License<br/>
----------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*<br/>
conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then<br/>
do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,<br/>
distribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text<br/>
of this license as a model for your own license, but your license<br/>
should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that<br/>
your work is distributed under the LPPL.<br/>
<br/>
The document `modguide.tex&apos; in the base LaTeX distribution explains<br/>
the motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,<br/>
for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public<br/>
License (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is<br/>
unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex&apos; may still be<br/>
relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any<br/>
license are encouraged to read it.<br/>
<br/>
A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own<br/>
personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for<br/>
distributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such<br/>
modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by<br/>
accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or<br/>
it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified<br/>
version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions<br/>
of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,<br/>
cause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your<br/>
best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public<br/>
one.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work<br/>
without altering any of its licensed components.<br/>
<br/>
How to Use This License<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
<br/>
To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both<br/>
an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work<br/>
was authored and/or last substantially modified.  Include also a<br/>
statement that the distribution and/or modification of that<br/>
component is constrained by the conditions in this license.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an example of such a notice and statement:<br/>
<br/>
  %% pig.dtx<br/>
  %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name<br/>
  %<br/>
  % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the<br/>
  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3<br/>
  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.<br/>
  % The latest version of this license is in<br/>
  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt<br/>
  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX<br/>
  % version 2005/12/01 or later.<br/>
  %<br/>
  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained&apos;.<br/>
  % <br/>
  % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.<br/>
  %<br/>
  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins<br/>
  % and the derived file pig.sty.<br/>
<br/>
Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions<br/>
given in this license document would apply, with the `Work&apos; referring<br/>
to the three files `pig.dtx&apos;, `pig.ins&apos;, and `pig.sty&apos; (the last being<br/>
generated from `pig.dtx&apos; using `pig.ins&apos;), the `Base Interpreter&apos;<br/>
referring to any `LaTeX-Format&apos;, and both `Copyright Holder&apos; and<br/>
`Current Maintainer&apos; referring to the person `M. Y. Name&apos;.<br/>
<br/>
If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your<br/>
Work, change `maintained&apos; above into `author-maintained&apos;.  <br/>
However, we recommend that you use `maintained&apos;, as the Maintenance<br/>
section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to<br/>
the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it<br/>
yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Derived Works That Are Not Replacements<br/>
---------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and<br/>
stability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves<br/>
with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a<br/>
(compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If<br/>
this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a<br/>
completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Important Recommendations<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
<br/>
 Defining What Constitutes the Work<br/>
<br/>
   The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the<br/>
   files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a<br/>
   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.<br/>
   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the<br/>
   files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by<br/>
   using a line such as:<br/>
<br/>
    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.<br/>
   <br/>
   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be<br/>
   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you<br/>
   to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be<br/>
   entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise<br/>
   the Work.
