CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE<br/>
LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN<br/>
ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION<br/>
ON AN &quot;AS-IS&quot; BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE<br/>
INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM<br/>
ITS USE.<br/>
<br/>
License<br/>
<br/>
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE<br/>
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;CCPL&quot; OR &quot;LICENSE&quot;). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY<br/>
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS<br/>
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.<br/>
<br/>
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE<br/>
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE<br/>
RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS<br/>
AND CONDITIONS.<br/>
<br/>
1. Definitions<br/>
<br/>
a. &quot;Collective Work&quot; means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology<br/>
or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form,<br/>
along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and<br/>
independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.<br/>
A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a<br/>
Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.<br/>
<br/>
b. &quot;Derivative Work&quot; means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work<br/>
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical<br/>
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,<br/>
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any<br/>
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,<br/>
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be<br/>
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the<br/>
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound<br/>
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a<br/>
moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered a Derivative Work for the<br/>
purpose of this License.<br/>
<br/>
c. &quot;Licensor&quot; means the individual or entity that offers the Work under<br/>
the terms of this License.<br/>
<br/>
d. &quot;Original Author&quot; means the individual or entity who created the<br/>
Work.<br/>
<br/>
e. &quot;Work&quot; means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the<br/>
terms of this License.<br/>
<br/>
f. &quot;You&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this<br/>
License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with<br/>
respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the<br/>
Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous<br/>
violation.<br/>
<br/>
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,<br/>
limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other<br/>
limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under<br/>
copyright law or other applicable laws.<br/>
<br/>
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,<br/>
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,<br/>
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to<br/>
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:<br/>
<br/>
a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more<br/>
Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the<br/>
Collective Works;<br/>
<br/>
b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;<br/>
<br/>
c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform<br/>
publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission<br/>
the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;<br/>
<br/>
d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform<br/>
publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission<br/>
Derivative Works;<br/>
<br/>
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now<br/>
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make<br/>
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights<br/>
in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor<br/>
are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth<br/>
in Sections 4(d) and 4(e).<br/>
<br/>
4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made<br/>
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:<br/>
<br/>
a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly<br/>
digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You<br/>
must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this<br/>
License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,<br/>
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You<br/>
may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the<br/>
terms of this License or the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted<br/>
hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all<br/>
notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.<br/>
You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly<br/>
digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control<br/>
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of<br/>
this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in<br/>
a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart<br/>
from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If<br/>
You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to<br/>
the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to<br/>
such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a<br/>
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent<br/>
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such<br/>
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.<br/>
<br/>
b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3<br/>
above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward<br/>
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of<br/>
the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or<br/>
otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward<br/>
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is<br/>
no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange<br/>
of copyrighted works.<br/>
<br/>
c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly<br/>
digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works,<br/>
You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the<br/>
Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are<br/>
utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the<br/>
Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the<br/>
extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any,<br/>
that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI<br/>
does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the<br/>
Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use<br/>
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., &quot;French translation of the<br/>
Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by<br/>
Original Author&quot;). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable<br/>
manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or<br/>
Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other<br/>
comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as<br/>
prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.<br/>
<br/>
d. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the<br/>
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance<br/>
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public<br/>
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if<br/>
that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial<br/>
advantage or private monetary compensation.<br/>
<br/>
ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the<br/>
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights<br/>
agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any<br/>
phonorecord You create from the Work (&quot;cover version&quot;) and distribute,<br/>
subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the<br/>
US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your<br/>
distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed<br/>
toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. Webcasting<br/>
Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the<br/>
Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to<br/>
collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.<br/>
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.<br/>
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17<br/>
USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other<br/>
jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily intended<br/>
for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary<br/>
compensation.<br/>
<br/>
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer<br/>
<br/>
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR<br/>
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY<br/>
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,<br/>
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,<br/>
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF<br/>
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,<br/>
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br/>
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br/>
<br/>
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE<br/>
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR<br/>
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES<br/>
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS<br/>
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
<br/>
7. Termination<br/>
<br/>
a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br/>
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.<br/>
Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective<br/>
Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses<br/>
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full<br/>
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will<br/>
survive any termination of this License.<br/>
<br/>
b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here<br/>
is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).<br/>
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the<br/>
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at<br/>
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to<br/>
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is<br/>
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this<br/>
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as<br/>
stated above.<br/>
<br/>
8. Miscellaneous<br/>
<br/>
a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a<br/>
Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the<br/>
Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You<br/>
under this License.<br/>
<br/>
b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative<br/>
Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on<br/>
the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this<br/>
License.<br/>
<br/>
c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under<br/>
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of<br/>
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action<br/>
by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to<br/>
the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and<br/>
enforceable.<br/>
<br/>
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no<br/>
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing<br/>
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.<br/>
<br/>
e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties<br/>
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,<br/>
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified<br/>
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may<br/>
appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified<br/>
without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.<br/>

liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages<br/>
whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,<br/>
incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this<br/>
license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative<br/>
Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it<br/>
shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.<br/>

is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark<br/>
